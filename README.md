# Lissajous Plotter

- This is a simple plotter for Lissajous Curves, built with only the 2D Canvas API.
- Lissajous Curves are a set of parametric equations that can be geometrically linked to two orthogonal springs "springing" at different rates
- For more information, see the first reference below
